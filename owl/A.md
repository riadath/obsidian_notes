Sauvage by Dior is a fragrance that embodies rugged elegance and refined simplicity. It's a scent that combines fresh and woody tones, making it versatile for various occasions. The top notes of Sauvage feature a fresh burst of Calabrian bergamot, providing a crisp and invigorating opening. This leads into the heart notes, where Sichuan pepper adds a spicy, vibrant layer, creating a dynamic contrast. The base notes ground the fragrance with ambroxan, derived from rare ambergris, offering a warm, slightly aquatic depth that adds to its complexity and allure.

The smell of Sauvage symbolizes freedom, a connection with the wild outdoors, and an unbridled masculinity. Itâ€™s designed for the modern man who is both elegant and boundless, someone who appreciates the beauty of nature and seeks to embody its untamed spirit.
