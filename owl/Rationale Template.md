### Prompt

The code you gave me still has a loop in it.
### Response

I apologize for the oversight. You can indeed find the first and last non-zero indices for each column without explicit loops using NumPy's capabilities for handling arrays. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming DS_array is your array
DS_array = np.random.randint(0, 2, (12108, 86))  # Replace this with your actual array

# Identify the rows with non-zero entries for each column
non_zero_rows = np.where(DS_array != 0)

# Get the column indices and corresponding row indices
col_indices, row_indices = non_zero_rows

# Create arrays to hold the first and last non-zero row indices for each column
# Initialize them with -1 to indicate that no non-zero row has been found
first_non_zero_rows = np.full(DS_array.shape[1], -1)
last_non_zero_rows = np.full(DS_array.shape[1], -1)

# Fill the first and last non-zero row indices arrays
<URL>(first_non_zero_rows, col_indices, row_indices)
<URL>(last_non_zero_rows, col_indices, row_indices)

# Replace -1 with None where no non-zero row was found
first_non_zero_rows[first_non_zero_rows == -1] = None
last_non_zero_rows[last_non_zero_rows == -1] = None

print("First non-zero rows:", first_non_zero_rows)
print("Last non-zero rows:", last_non_zero_rows)

```

In this example:

- `np.where(DS_array != 0)` returns a tuple of row and column indices where the array has non-zero elements.
- `np.full` is used to initialize `first_non_zero_rows` and `last_non_zero_rows` arrays.
- `np.minimum.at` and `np.maximum.at` are "ufunc.at" methods that apply a "reduceat" operation along the specified indices. They help us get the minimum and maximum row indices for each column, effectively capturing the first and last non-zero row for each column.
- Finally, we replace the -1 values with `None` to indicate columns where no non-zero row was found.

The code avoids explicit `for` loops by leveraging NumPy's array operations.



### Final Prompt
When I run `np.minimum.at(first_non_zero_rows, col_indices, row_indices)`, I get `IndexError: index 3457 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 86`.
