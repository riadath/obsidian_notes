Sure! The Python function `isPalindrome` checks if an integer is a palindrome by efficiently reversing only the second half of the number, and then comparing it to the first half. Here's the detailed implementation:

```python
def isPalindrome(x):
    # Negative numbers and numbers ending in 0 (except 0 itself) are not palindromes
    if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):
        return False

    reversed_num = 0
    while x > reversed_num:
        # Build the reversed number from the rightmost digit of x
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + x % 10
        # Remove the rightmost digit from x
        x //= 10

    # x is the left half of the number, and reversed_num is the right half
    # If the length of the number is odd, we get rid of the middle digit by reversed_num // 10
    return x == reversed_num or x == reversed_num // 10

# Test cases
print(isPalindrome(121))  # Output: True
print(isPalindrome(-121))  # Output: False
print(isPalindrome(10))   # Output: False
```

Key points in the code:

1. **Handling Special Cases**: The function first checks for numbers that cannot be palindromes, such as negative numbers or those ending in 0 (excluding 0 itself).

2. **Reversing Half of the Number**: A variable `reversed_num` is initialized to 0. In the `while` loop, digits from the right half of `x` are successively added to `reversed_num`. Once `reversed_num` equals or exceeds half of `x`, the loop terminates. This approach only reverses the second half of the number, making it more efficient.

3. **Comparing Halves**: The final check compares the left half (`x`) and the right half (`reversed_num`). For an odd-length number, the middle digit is irrelevant in determining if it's a palindrome, so `reversed_num // 10` is used to ignore the middle digit.
