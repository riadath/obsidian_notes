### Prompt
Check if a number is a palindrome without converting it to a string.

### Response
Yes, you can solve the problem of checking if an integer is a palindrome without converting it to a string by reversing the integer mathematically and then comparing it with the original integer. Here's how you can do it in Python:

```python
def isPalindrome(x):
    # Negative numbers are not palindromes
    if x < 0:
        return False

    # Store the original value of x
    original_x = x
    reversed_x = 0

    while x > 0:
        # Extract the last digit of x
        last_digit = x % 10

        # Append the last digit to reversed_x
        reversed_x = reversed_x * 10 + last_digit

        # Remove the last digit from x
        x = x // 10

    # Check if the reversed integer is the same as the original
    return original_x == reversed_x

# Test cases
print(isPalindrome(121))  # Output: True
print(isPalindrome(-121))  # Output: False
print(isPalindrome(10))   # Output: False
```

In this code:

1. First, we handle a quick check: if `x` is negative, it's not a palindrome, so we return `False`.

2. We store the original value of `x` to compare it later with the reversed version.

3. We initialize `reversed_x` to 0. This variable will hold the reversed integer.

4. Then, we use a `while` loop to reverse `x` mathematically. In each iteration, we:
   - Extract the last digit of `x` using `x % 10`.
   - Append the last digit to `reversed_x` by multiplying `reversed_x` by 10 and adding the last digit.
   - Remove the last digit from `x` by performing integer division by 10 (`x // 10`).

5. Finally, we compare the original value of `x` with the reversed integer. If they are the same, `x` is a palindrome, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
