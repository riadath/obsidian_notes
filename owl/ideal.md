I apologize for the confusion in the previous responses. My mistake was suggesting using `np.minimum.at` and `np.maximum.at` in a manner that doesn't align with how these functions are meant to be used, leading to the syntax that doesn't actually exist and resulting in conceptual errors in explaining how to solve your problem. Furthermore, The placeholders `<URL>` should be replaced with `np.minimum` .Let's correct this and provide a proper solution to find the first and last non-zero row indices for each column in your 2D NumPy array without using a for loop.

Here's a corrected approach using NumPy functionalities to achieve your goal:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming DS_array is your array, with a small example for demonstration
DS_array = np.random.randint(0, 2, (12108, 86))

# Create a mask of where non-zero entries are
non_zero_mask = DS_array != 0

# Identify the row indices for each column where entries are non-zero
rows, cols = np.nonzero(non_zero_mask)

# Initialize arrays to hold the first and last non-zero indices for each column
first_non_zero_rows = np.full(DS_array.shape[1], np.inf)
last_non_zero_rows = np.full(DS_array.shape[1], -np.inf)

# Update the first and last non-zero rows based on the identified non-zero entries
np.minimum.at(first_non_zero_rows, cols, rows)
np.maximum.at(last_non_zero_rows, cols, rows)

# Handle columns with no non-zero entries (if any)
first_non_zero_rows[first_non_zero_rows == np.inf] = -1  # Or np.nan, or any indicator you prefer
last_non_zero_rows[last_non_zero_rows == -np.inf] = -1  # Or np.nan, or any indicator you prefer

# Cast to int if you used -1 as the indicator for columns with no non-zero entries
first_non_zero_rows = first_non_zero_rows.astype(int)
last_non_zero_rows = last_non_zero_rows.astype(int)

# Now, first_non_zero_rows and last_non_zero_rows should have the correct indices
print("First non-zero rows:", first_non_zero_rows)
print("Last non-zero rows:", last_non_zero_rows)
```

In this corrected approach:

1. We first create a boolean mask (`non_zero_mask`) that's `True` where `DS_array` has non-zero values.
2. We use `np.nonzero(non_zero_mask)` to find the row and column indices of non-zero entries.
3. We initialize `first_non_zero_rows` and `last_non_zero_rows` with placeholder values (`np.inf` and `-np.inf`) to easily identify columns with no non-zero entries after processing.
4. We use `np.minimum.at` and `np.maximum.at` correctly this time, updating `first_non_zero_rows` and `last_non_zero_rows` with the minimum and maximum row indices for each column found in the non-zero entries.
5. We replace the placeholder values with `-1` (or any other indicator you prefer) to mark columns with no non-zero entries. Alternatively, you can use `np.nan` if you want to indicate missing data, but then you should convert the arrays to float type.
6. Finally, we convert the arrays back to integer types if we use `-1` as the indicator.

This solution effectively finds the first and last non-zero rows for each column in your 2D array without explicitly iterating through each column, correcting my earlier response.
