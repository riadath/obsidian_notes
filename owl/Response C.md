Implementing a simple Blackjack game using Pygame requires some basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with the Pygame library. Below is a basic structure of how you could implement such a game. This example is quite simplified and doesn't cover all Blackjack rules and features, but it will provide a good starting point.

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Here's a simple implementation:

```python
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants for the game
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
CARD_WIDTH = 70
CARD_HEIGHT = 100
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption('Simple Blackjack')

# Load card images or represent cards using rectangles for simplicity
# In a full game, you would load images for each card

# Function to draw a simple card
def draw_card(x, y, value):
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, WHITE, (x, y, CARD_WIDTH, CARD_HEIGHT))
    font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
    text = font.render(str(value), 1, BLACK)
    screen.blit(text, (x + 10, y + 10))

# Basic game variables
deck = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11] * 4  # Simple deck
player_hand = []
dealer_hand = []

# Function to deal a card
def deal_card(hand):
    card = random.choice(deck)
    hand.append(card)
    deck.remove(card)

# Function to calculate hand total
def hand_total(hand):
    return sum(hand)

# Function to draw the hands
def draw_hands():
    for i, card in enumerate(player_hand):
        draw_card(100 + i * (CARD_WIDTH + 10), 500, card)
    for i, card in enumerate(dealer_hand):
        draw_card(100 + i * (CARD_WIDTH + 10), 100, card)

# Start with initial hands
deal_card(player_hand)
deal_card(dealer_hand)
deal_card(player_hand)
deal_card(dealer_hand)

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    screen.fill(GREEN)

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_h:  # Hit
                deal_card(player_hand)
            if event.key == pygame.K_s:  # Stand
                while hand_total(dealer_hand) < 17:  # Simple AI for dealer
                    deal_card(dealer_hand)
                running = False  # End game after player stands

    draw_hands()

    # Check for busts or blackjack
    player_total = hand_total(player_hand)
    dealer_total = hand_total(dealer_hand)

    if player_total > 21 or dealer_total == 21:
        running = False
    elif dealer_total > 21 or player_total == 21:
        running = False

    pygame.display.flip()

# Game over, determine winner
screen.fill(GREEN)
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 74)
if player_total > 21 or (dealer_total <= 21 and dealer_total > player_total):
    text = font.render('Dealer Wins', 1, BLACK)
elif dealer_total > 21 or player_total > dealer_total:
    text = font.render('Player Wins', 1, BLACK)
else:
    text = font.render('Tie', 1, BLACK)

screen.blit(text, (SCREEN_WIDTH // 2 - text.get_width() // 2, SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2 - text.get_height() // 2))
pygame.display.flip()

# Pause for a moment before closing
pygame.time.wait(2000)
pygame.quit()
```

This code provides a simple text-based Blackjack game using Pygame. The game deals two cards to the player and dealer, allows the player to hit or stand, and determines the winner based on the total hand values. Dealer AI will hit until its hand is at least 17.

To make this game more engaging, consider adding:

- Real card images
- Splitting, doubling down, and insurance options
- A betting system
- More robust dealer AI

Remember, Blackjack has various rules variations, so ensure you're implementing the version you prefer or a standard set of rules. This script is a basic structure and will need additional error checking and features for a full game experience.

Here's what to consider:
- Doesn't provide a brief description of the blackjack rules
- Provides installation guidelines for `Pygame`
