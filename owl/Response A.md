Implementing a simple Blackjack game using Pygame in Python requires some understanding of both the game's rules and Pygame basics. Below is a very simplified version of the game. Please make sure you have Python and Pygame installed in your system before you run this code.

Before starting, you might want to know the basic rules of Blackjack:

- The goal is to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible, without going over.
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points. Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points. All other cards are worth their number value.
- Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
- 'Hit' to take another card.
- 'Stand' if you don't want any more cards.

This code won't fully implement all rules and features of Blackjack, but it's a start.

```python
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT = 800, 600
BG_COLOR = (7, 99, 36)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
FONT = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
CARD_VALUES = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10, 'J': 10, 'Q': 10, 'K': 10, 'A': 11}

# Setup screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption('Blackjack')

def draw_text(text, font, color, surface, x, y):
    textobj = font.render(text, 1, color)
    textrect = textobj.get_rect()
    textrect.topleft = (x, y)
    surface.blit(textobj, textrect)

def get_hand_value(hand):
    value = sum(CARD_VALUES[card] for card in hand)
    # Adjust for Aces
    num_aces = hand.count('A')
    while value > 21 and num_aces:
        value -= 10
        num_aces -= 1
    return value

def main():
    running = True
    deck = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'] * 4
    player_hand = [random.choice(deck), random.choice(deck)]
    dealer_hand = [random.choice(deck), random.choice(deck)]

    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        
        screen.fill(BG_COLOR)
        
        # Show player's hand
        draw_text(f'Your hand: {", ".join(player_hand)} (Total: {get_hand_value(player_hand)})', FONT, WHITE, screen, 50, 500)
        
        # Show dealer's hand
        dealer_display = ' '.join(dealer_hand[:1]) + ' ?'
        draw_text(f"Dealer's hand: {dealer_display}", FONT, WHITE, screen, 50, 100)
        
        # Update the screen
        pygame.display.update()
        
        # Game logic (very simplified)
        player_value = get_hand_value(player_hand)
        dealer_value = get_hand_value(dealer_hand)

        if player_value > 21:
            draw_text('Busted! You lose.', FONT, WHITE, screen, 300, 300)
            pygame.display.update()
            pygame.time.wait(2000)
            running = False
        elif player_value == 21:
            draw_text('Blackjack! You win!', FONT, WHITE, screen, 300, 300)
            pygame.display.update()
            pygame.time.wait(2000)
            running = False

    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This is a highly simplified version of Blackjack and doesn't include features like betting, splitting, doubling down, or even properly handling input for 'hit' or 'stand'. This code sets up a basic game where you can see your hand and the dealer's first card. The game automatically checks if you've got more than 21 points or exactly 21 (a win condition). You would need to expand the game logic to make it a fully playable game.

For a full game, you'd need to:
- Handle user inputs for 'hit' and 'stand.'
- Implement the logic for the dealer's actions.
- Include betting and chip tracking.
- Add graphics for cards and perhaps animations. 

This would make a great project if you're looking to get more experience with Python and Pygame!



Write a content rationale for the response. Here's what to consider:

- The response only partially fulfills the user's request
- The game does not work properly since this is a half-baked version of the game
- The game does not have any feature for user input which makes the game unplayable
- The response does mention the rules of the game in detail which is good.
- The response also mentions all the shortcomings and mentions what the user needs to implement to complete the game.

Write the rationale in 6-7 sentences. Write in paragraphs and don't use points. make it simple, clear and concise.
