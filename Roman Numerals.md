# Response A

You are absolutely right; "XXVII" is indeed equal to 27. My apologies for the repeated mistakes in the explanation. Let's correct the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialize variables**:
   - `total` to keep track of the running total, initially set to 0.
   - `prev_value` to keep track of the value of the previous Roman numeral character, initially set to 0.

2. **Start iterating** through the Roman numeral string from right to left (reversed):
   - The first character is 'I,' which has a value of 1. Since it's the rightmost character, there is no previous character to compare with, so we add its value to `total`, making `total` equal to 1. We update `prev_value` to 1.
   - The next character is 'I' again, with a value of 1. Since it's the same as the previous character ('I'), we add its value to `total`, making `total` equal to 2. We update `prev_value` to 1.
   - The next character is 'V,' which has a value of 5. Now we compare 'V' (5) with the previous character 'I' (1). Since 'V' is greater than 'I,' we add 'V' (5) to the `total`, making `total` equal to 7 (5 + 2 = 7). We update `prev_value` to 5.
   - The next character is 'X,' which has a value of 10. Now we compare 'X' (10) with the previous character 'V' (5). Since 'X' is greater than 'V,' we add 'X' (10) to the `total`, making `total` equal to 17 (10 + 7 = 17). We update `prev_value` to 10.
   - The final character is 'X' again, with a value of 10. Since it's the same as the previous character ('X'), we add its value to `total`, making `total` equal to 27 (17 + 10 = 27). We update `prev_value` to 10.

3. The iteration is complete, and we've processed all the characters in the Roman numeral string. The final value of `total` is 27, which is the correct integer equivalent of the Roman numeral "XXVII."

So, "XXVII" in Roman numerals is indeed equal to 27 in decimal (integer) notation. I apologize for the repeated errors, and thank you for your patience.
