 - $q_0, q_1, q_3$ are states . $q_0$ is the start state and $q_2$ is the final state (also called accept states)
- arrows are called transitions 
- For some input string i.e. "1011" the output is either accept or reject

## Finite Automata for Figure 1.4

- If $A$ is the set of all strings that machine $M$ accepts, we say that $A$ is the language of machine $M$ and write $L(M) = A$. We say that $M$ recognizes $A$ or that $M$ accepts A

# <u><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Nondeterminism</mark></u>

- When the machine is in a given state and reads the next input symbol, we know what the next state will beâ€”it is determined. We call this deterministic computation. In a nondeterministic machine, several choices may exist for the next state at any point.
