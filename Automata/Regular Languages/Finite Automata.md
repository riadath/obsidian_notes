 - $q_0, q_1, q_3$ are states . $q_0$ is the start state and $q_2$ is the final state (also called accept states)
- arrows are called transitions 
- For some input string i.e. "1011" the output is either accept or reject

- If $A$ is the set of all strings that machine $M$ accepts, we say that $A$ is the language of machine $M$ and write $L(M) = A$. We say that $M$ recognizes $A$ or that $M$ accepts A
