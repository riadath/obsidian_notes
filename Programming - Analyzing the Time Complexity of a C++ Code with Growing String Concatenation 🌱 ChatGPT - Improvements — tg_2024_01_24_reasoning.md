## Prompt
Consider the following piece of C++ code:

string s = "a"; for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { s = s + s; // Concatenate s with itself. }

Usually, when analyzing the time complexity of a piece of code, we would determine how much work the inner loop does, then multiply it by the number of times the outer loop runs. However, in this case, the amount of work done by the inner loop varies from iteration to iteration, since the string being built up gets longer and longer. How would you analyze this code to get the big-O time complexity?

## Response
To analyze the time complexity of this C++ code snippet, let's break down the operation and its impact on performance step by step. The code is designed to concatenate a string with itself in each iteration of the loop, effectively doubling its length with each pass.

1. **Understanding the Operation**: The key operation inside the loop is `s = s + s;`. This doubles the length of string `s` in each iteration. If `s` starts as a single character, after the first iteration, its length is 2. After the second iteration, its length is 4, then 8, 16, and so on. This is a geometric progression in terms of string length, where the length of `s` after `i` iterations is 2�2i.
    
2. **Work Done in Each Iteration**: The amount of work (or time) it takes to concatenate two strings is proportional to the sum of their lengths. Initially, this seems straightforward, but because `s` doubles in length each time, the work done in each iteration is not constant. Instead, it grows exponentially with `i`. After �i iterations, the work done is proportional to 2�2i.
    
3. **Total Work Done**: To find the total work done over all iterations, we need to sum the work done in each iteration. However, since each iteration doubles the length of `s`, and thus doubles the work, we are essentially summing a series of the form 20+21+22+⋯+2�−120+21+22+⋯+2n−1. This sum can be represented as a geometric series.
    
4. **Sum of Geometric Series**: The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula ∑�=0�−1���=�1−��1−�∑k=0n−1​ark=a1−r1−rn​, where �a is the first term of the series, and �r is the common ratio. In our case, �=1a=1 and �=2r=2, so the sum after �n iterations (or for �n terms) is 11−2�1−2=2�−111−21−2n​=2n−1. This represents the total amount of work done, corresponding to the total length of strings that have been concatenated over all iterations.
    
5. **Big-O Notation**: The Big-O notation aims to describe the upper bound of the algorithm's complexity, focusing on the worst-case scenario as the input size grows. The total work done is 2�−12n−1, which is dominated by 2�2n as �n grows large. Therefore, the time complexity of the given code snippet is �(2�)O(2n), indicating an exponential time complexity.
    

In summary, this C++ code snippet exhibits exponential time complexity (�(2�)O(2n)) because the work done in each iteration grows exponentially with the number of iterations, and the total amount of work is essentially the sum of a geometric series with a ratio of 2. This is a significant insight because it highlights how quickly performance can degrade with seemingly simple operations like string concatenation in a loop, especially when the size of the data structure being manipulated (in this case, a string) grows exponentially with each iteration
