## Prompt 1
perfect I want a Blank Window of size 700 by 500 with background color #17202a in Tkinter. The title of the game is " The Number Ninja Game". Give me the output with detailed comments for each line.
## Response 1
Certainly! Below is the code for a blank window in Tkinter with your specifications:
```python
# Import the required modules from tkinter

import tkinter as tk

  

# Create a root window object

root = tk.Tk()

  

# Set the title of the window

root.title("The Number Ninja Game")

  

# Set the size of the window

root.geometry("700x500")

  

# Set the background color of the window

root.configure(bg="#17202a")

  

# Main event loop: This keeps the window running and responsive

root.mainloop()
```
Let's break down the code:

1. **`import tkinter as tk`**: This imports the required modules from the `tkinter` library.
2. **`root = tk.Tk()`**: Initializes the main window object. Think of `root` as the main container for all other GUI components.
3. **`root.title("The Number Ninja Game")`**: This sets the title of the window to "The Number Ninja Game".
4. **`root.geometry("700x500")`**: Sets the dimensions of the window to 700 pixels in width and 500 pixels in height.
5. **`root.configure(bg="#17202a")`**: Configures the background color of the main window with the color code `#17202a`.
6. **`root.mainloop()`**: This line starts the main event loop. It keeps the window open, waiting for events like button clicks, mouse movements, or keystrokes. Without this loop, the window would immediately close after opening.

Copy the code into a Python script and run it. You should see a blank window with the specified size, title, and background color.
## Final Prompt

perfect 2 seconds after the blank window opens , I want a fade-in message " Welcome! to the Number Ninja Game" to be displayed in the Middle of the window. Add this as extension to previous code. Don't break or change previous functionalities and GUI settings. Give me the output with detailed comments for each line.

```python
import tkinter as tk

  

root = tk.Tk()

root.title("The Number Ninja Game")

root.geometry("700x500")

root.configure(bg="#17202a")

  

# Function to create the fade-in effect

def fade_in():

    # Create a canvas widget

    canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=700, height=500, bg="#17202a", bd=0, highlightthickness=0)

    canvas.pack()

  

    # Set the initial color

    alpha = 0  # initial alpha value (0 is fully transparent, 255 is fully opaque)

  

    # Create the text on the canvas

    text_id = canvas.create_text(350, 250, text="Welcome! to the Number Ninja Game", fill="#ffffff", font=("Helvetica", 24))

  

    # Loop to create the fade-in effect

    for i in range(50):

        alpha += 5  # Increase alpha value by 5 in each iteration

        alpha_hex = hex(alpha)[2:]  # Convert alpha value to hexadecimal

        color = f"#{alpha_hex}ffffff"  # Combine alpha_hex with white color code

        canvas.itemconfig(text_id, fill=color)  # Change text color

        root.update()  # Update the root window to display the new color

        root.after(50)  # Pause for 50 milliseconds

  

# Schedule the fade_in function to run after 2 seconds

root.after(2000, fade_in)

  

root.mainloop()
```
