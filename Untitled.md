## Prompt 1
perfect I want a Blank Window of size 700 by 500 with background color #17202a in Tkinter. The title of the game is " The Number Ninja Game". Give me the output with detailed comments for each line.
## Response 1
Certainly! Below is the code for a blank window in Tkinter with your specifications:
```python
# Import the required modules from tkinter

import tkinter as tk

  

# Create a root window object

root = tk.Tk()

  

# Set the title of the window

root.title("The Number Ninja Game")

  

# Set the size of the window

root.geometry("700x500")

  

# Set the background color of the window

root.configure(bg="#17202a")

  

# Main event loop: This keeps the window running and responsive

root.mainloop()
```
Let's break down the code:

1. **`import tkinter as tk`**: This imports the required modules from the `tkinter` library.
2. **`root = tk.Tk()`**: Initializes the main window object. Think of `root` as the main container for all other GUI components.
3. **`root.title("The Number Ninja Game")`**: This sets the title of the window to "The Number Ninja Game".
4. **`root.geometry("700x500")`**: Sets the dimensions of the window to 700 pixels in width and 500 pixels in height.
5. **`root.configure(bg="#17202a")`**: Configures the background color of the main window with the color code `#17202a`.
6. **`root.mainloop()`**: This line starts the main event loop. It keeps the window open, waiting for events like button clicks, mouse movements, or keystrokes. Without this loop, the window would immediately close after opening.

Copy the code into a Python script and run it. You should see a blank window with the specified size, title, and background color.
## Final Prompt

perfect 2 seconds after the blank window opens , I want a fade-in message " Welcome! to the Number Ninja Game" to be displayed in the Middle of the window. Add this as extension to previous code. Don't break or change previous functionalities and GUI settings. Give me the output with detailed comments for each line.
## Final Response to Rate
Adding a fade-in effect in Tkinter can be a bit tricky because Tkinter does not have built-in support for animations or effects like that. However, you can create a fade-in effect by incrementally changing the text color from the background color to the desired text color.

Below is your original code with an extension that adds the fade-in text:
```python
import tkinter as tk

  

# Function to create the fade-in effect

def fade_in_text(canvas, text_id):

    # list of color shades from background color to white

    color_shades = ['#17202a', '#2c3e50', '#34495e', '#5d6d7e', '#85929e', '#aab7b8', '#ccd1d1', '#e5e8e8', '#f7dc6f', '#f1c40f', '#f0e68c', '#ffffff']

  

    # update text color every 100 ms to the next shade in the list

    for i, color in enumerate(color_shades):

        canvas.after(i * 100, canvas.itemconfig, text_id, {'fill': color})

  

# Create a root window object

root = tk.Tk()

  

# Set the title of the window

root.title("The Number Ninja Game")

  

# Set the size of the window

root.geometry("700x500")

  

# Set the background color of the window

root.configure(bg="#17202a")

  

# Create a Canvas widget

canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=700, height=500, bg="#17202a", bd=0, highlightthickness=0)

canvas.pack()

  

# Create text on the canvas

text_id = canvas.create_text(350, 250, text="Welcome! to the Number Ninja Game", font=('Helvetica', 24, 'bold'), fill="#17202a")

  

# Call the fade_in_text function after 2 seconds

root.after(2000, fade_in_text, canvas, text_id)

  

# Main event loop

root.mainloop()
```
Let me explain the new parts of the code:

1. **`fade_in_text(canvas, text_id)` Function**:
    
    - This function will create the fade-in effect by changing the color of the text from the background color to white over a series of steps.
    - `color_shades` is a list of color codes from the background color to white. These colors were chosen to gradually change from the background color to white, creating a fade-in effect.
    - The `for` loop iterates over the `color_shades` list, setting the text color to the next shade every 100 milliseconds. This is done using the `after` method, which schedules a function to be called after a certain amount of time.
2. **Canvas Widget**:
    
    - A `Canvas` widget is used to draw graphics, like lines or text, on the window.
    - The `Canvas` is created with the same background color as the window and no border or highlight thickness.
3. **Creating Text**:
    
    - The `create_text` method creates text on the `Canvas` at the specified coordinates (350, 250), which is the center of the window. The `create_text` method returns an ID for the text, which is used to modify the text later.
4. **`root.after(2000, fade_in_text, canvas, text_id)`**:
    
    - This line schedules the `fade_in_text` function to be called 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds) after the program starts. The `fade_in_text` function will then gradually change the color of the text to create the fade-in effect.
