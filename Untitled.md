## Prompt 1
perfect I want a Blank Window of size 700 by 500 with background color #17202a in Tkinter. The title of the game is " The Number Ninja Game". Give me the output with detailed comments for each line.
## Response 1
Certainly! Below is the code for a blank window in Tkinter with your specifications:
```python
# Import the required modules from tkinter

import tkinter as tk

  

# Create a root window object

root = tk.Tk()

  

# Set the title of the window

root.title("The Number Ninja Game")

  

# Set the size of the window

root.geometry("700x500")

  

# Set the background color of the window

root.configure(bg="#17202a")

  

# Main event loop: This keeps the window running and responsive

root.mainloop()
```
Let's break down the code:

1. **`import tkinter as tk`**: This imports the required modules from the `tkinter` library.
2. **`root = tk.Tk()`**: Initializes the main window object. Think of `root` as the main container for all other GUI components.
3. **`root.title("The Number Ninja Game")`**: This sets the title of the window to "The Number Ninja Game".
4. **`root.geometry("700x500")`**: Sets the dimensions of the window to 700 pixels in width and 500 pixels in height.
5. **`root.configure(bg="#17202a")`**: Configures the background color of the main window with the color code `#17202a`.
6. **`root.mainloop()`**: This line starts the main event loop. It keeps the window open, waiting for events like button clicks, mouse movements, or keystrokes. Without this loop, the window would immediately close after opening.

Copy the code into a Python script and run it. You should see a blank window with the specified size, title, and background color.
## Final Prompt

perfect 2 seconds after the blank window opens , I want a fade-in message " Welcome! to the Number Ninja Game" to be displayed in the Middle of the window. Add this as extension to previous code. Don't break or change previous functionalities and GUI settings. Give me the output with detailed comments for each line.
## Final Response to Rate
Adding a fade-in effect can be a bit tricky with `Tkinter` as it doesn't have built-in support for such animations. However, you can create a similar effect by gradually changing the color of the text.

Here's how you can modify your previous code to display a welcome message that fades in:
```python
import tkinter as tk

  

root = tk.Tk()

root.title("The Number Ninja Game")

root.geometry("700x500")

root.configure(bg="#17202a")

  

# Function to change the color of the text

def fade_in(step=0):

    # List of color codes representing the fade-in effect

    # Starts from black and goes to white

    colors = ["#000000", "#1a1a1a", "#333333", "#4d4d4d", "#666666",

              "#7f7f7f", "#999999", "#b3b3b3", "#cccccc", "#e6e6e6", "#ffffff"]

  

    # If step is less than the number of colors, set the label's color to the current step's color

    if step < len(colors):

        label.config(fg=colors[step])

        root.after(200, fade_in, step+1)

  

# Create a Label widget to display the welcome text

label = tk.Label(root, text="Welcome! to the Number Ninja Game", font=("Helvetica", 32), bg="#17202a")

label.pack(anchor="center", expand=True)

  

# Call the fade_in function after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)

root.after(2000, fade_in)

  

root.mainloop()
```
Explanation of new code:

- **`fade_in(step=0)`**: This function will change the color of the `Label` text from black to white, creating a fade-in effect. It takes an optional `step` parameter, which is the index of the current color in the `colors` list.
    
- **`colors`**: This is a list of color codes representing different shades of grey, starting from black and ending with white.
    
- **`label.config(fg=colors[step])`**: This sets the `Label` text color to the current step's color.
    
- **`root.after(200, fade_in, step+1)`**: This schedules the `fade_in` function to be called again after 200 milliseconds with the next step.
    
- **`label = tk.Label(...)`**: This creates a `Label` widget to display the welcome text.
    
- **`label.pack(anchor="center", expand=True)`**: This positions the `Label` in the middle of the window.
    
- **`root.after(2000, fade_in)`**: This schedules the `fade_in` function to be called after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) from when the window opens.
