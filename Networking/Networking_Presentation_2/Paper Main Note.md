# Abstract

### What we're trying to do
- Considering the vehicle position and velocity formulate a min-max optimization problem in order to optimize
	- Computation Capability
	- Transmission Power
	- Local Model Accuracy to get min cost in worst case of FL
- The formulated problem is a [[Nonlinear Programming]] problem subdivided into two problems
	- For resource
