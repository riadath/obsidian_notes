# Abstract

### What we're trying to do
- Considering the vehicle position and velocity formulate a min-max optimization problem in order to optimize
	- Computation Capability
	- Transmission Power
	- Local Model Accuracy to get min cost in worst case of FL
- The formulated problem is a [[Nonlinear Programming]] problem subdivided into two problems
	- **For resource allocation:** Lagrangian Dual + Subgradient Projection method
	- **local model accuracy:** And adaptive harmony algorithm

# Introduction

### <u>Challenges to be solved in Autonomous Driving</u>

####  Service Switching between edge servers efficiently

- In the context of vehicular edge computing (VEC), service switching between edge servers refers to the process of vehicles moving between the coverage areas of different edge servers while still maintaining their connection to the network. 
#### How to select vehicles with the best image quality for training
