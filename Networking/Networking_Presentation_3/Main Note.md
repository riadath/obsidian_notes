# Abstract

### <u>Dynamic Voronoi Partitions</u>

Dynamic Voronoi is a technique used in the proposed cooperative exploration approach for multiple mobile robots to minimize duplicated exploration areas by assigning different target locations to individual robots. [It is developed using dynamic Voronoi partitions](http://wiki.ros.org/dynamicvoronoi) [1](http://wiki.ros.org/dynamicvoronoi). The Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. [In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
