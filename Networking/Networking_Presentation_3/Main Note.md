# Abstract

### <u>Dynamic Voronoi Partitions</u>

Dynamic Voronoi is a technique used in the proposed cooperative exploration approach for multiple mobile robots to minimize duplicated exploration areas by assigning different target locations to individual robots. [It is developed using dynamic Voronoi partitions](http://wiki.ros.org/dynamicvoronoi) [1](http://wiki.ros.org/dynamicvoronoi).
The Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. [Voronoi diagram - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20Voronoi%20diagram,%2C%20sites%2C%20or%20generators).
