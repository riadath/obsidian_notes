## Question 4 !!!!! (You get a chocolate \[any brand\] if you can solve this)

Define an operation called 'axing' where we take a number 'a' and look at the sum of its digits and assign the sum to the number itself. 
We call a number 'fine' if you take less than x operations for it to converge to less than 10.
Find the number of 'fine' numbers from l to r.
