# <u>Abstract</u>


### <u>Summary</u>
The selected text is an abstract from a research paper on Federated Deep Learning (FDL) for zero-day botnet attack detection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The paper proposes using FDL to avoid data privacy leakage in IoT edge devices. The method employs an optimal Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture for network traffic classification and uses a Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm to aggregate local model updates. The results of the experiments show that the FDL model outperforms traditional Centralized DL (CDL), Localized DL, and Distributed DL methods in detecting <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">zero-day botnet attacks</mark>, guaranteeing data privacy and security, having low communication overhead, requiring low memory space for the storage of training data, and having low network latency.

### <u>Important Terms</u>

##### <u>Zero Day Attacks</u>
he term "zero-day" refers to the fact that the vendor or developer has only just learned of the flaw – which means they have “zero days” to fix it. A zero-day attack takes place when hackers exploit the flaw before developers have a chance to address it.

#### <u>Botnet Attacks</u>
A botnet attack is any attack leveraging a botnet—a group of bots and devices linked together to perform the same task—for distribution and scaling. Botnet attacks are used by cybercriminals to carry out intense scraping, DDoS etc.

#### <u>Federated Deep Learning</u>
Federated deep learning is a machine learning technique that trains an algorithm via multiple independent sessions, each using its own dataset. This approach stands in contrast to traditional centralized machine learning techniques where local datasets are merged into one training session, as well as to approaches that assume that local data samples are identically distributed. Federated deep learning enables multiple actors to build a common, robust machine learning model without sharing data.
