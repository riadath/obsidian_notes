## Earth Mover's Distance
Earth Moverâ€™s Distance (EMD) is a measure of the distance between two probability distributions over a region. In the context of the selected text, EMD is used to measure the distance between the data distribution on a client and the whole data distribution.

### Wiki
In computer science, the earth mover's distance (EMD) is a distance-like measure of dissimilarity between two frequency distributions, densities, or measures over a region D. For probability distributions and normalized histograms, it reduces to the Wasserstein metric $W_1$ 
Informally, if the distributions are interpreted as two different ways of piling up earth (dirt) over the region D, the EMD captures the minimum cost of building the smaller pile using dirt taken from the larger, where cost is defined as the amount of dirt moved multiplied by the ground distance over which it is moved
