## <u> Distributed Systems</u>
- Database is stored in different computers and they communicate with each other using various communication media
-  Computers in a distributed system is referred to as **Sites** or **Nodes**
- Transactions in distributed system
	- Local : access data in a single site
	- Global : accesses a different site or multiple site 

## <u>Distributed Databases</u>
- Homogenous distributed databases
	- Same software/schema in all sites
	- Goal: Provide view of a single database
* Heterogenous distributed databases
	*  different schema or software in different sites
	* Goal: Integrate existing databases to proved useful functionality 


## <u>Trade-offs in distributed systems</u>
### <u>Advantages:</u>
- Sharing Data
- Autonomy 
- Higher system availability through redundancy
### <u>Disadvantages</u>
- Software development cost
- Greater potential for bugs
- increased processing overhead
- 
 
## <u>Trade offs in distributed databases</u>
<u>Advantages</u>
- convenient and transparent access to data
- More reliable . If one site fails the database can continue
- allows for parallel execution of queries
<u>Disadvantages</u>
- Costlier

### Replication
- Useful when there are many read-only transactions at different sites wanting access to the same data.
- They can all execute quickly in parallel, accessing local data
- update is difficult
### Fragmentation 
- useful when transactions on different sites tend to access different parts of the database
