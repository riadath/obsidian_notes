# Common Parallel database architectures
- Shared Memory
- Shared Disk
- Shared Nothing
- Hierarchical

## Shared Memory
All processors share a common memory.

<u><b>Upside</b></u> : Processors can send message between each other much  
<u><b>Downside</b></u> : Architecture is not scalable above 32/64 processing cores since the memory bus or interconnect becomes the bottleneck.

### Modern shared memory Architecture
Each processor is directly connected to a bank of memory

## Shared Disk
Set of nodes share a common set of disks. Each node has it's own processor and memory.

<u>Upside</u>: 
- Memory bus is not a bottleneck.
- cheap way of fault tolerance
<u>Downside</u>: 
- Bandwidth of network < bandwidth to access storage
- Scale to a large number of processors but communication across processor is slow due to network bandwidth limitations

### Modern Shared Disk Architecture
* Storage area network (SAN) high speed local area network

### Shared Nothing
Set of nodes have not common disk, memory or processor

### Hierarchical 
A hybrid of the above systems
