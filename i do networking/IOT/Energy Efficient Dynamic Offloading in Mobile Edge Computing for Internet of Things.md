#### <u>Summary</u>
The text you selected is about energy-efficient task offloading in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for Internet of Things (IoT). The authors propose an energy-efficient dynamic offloading algorithm called EEDOA to minimize the energy consumption of task offloading while guaranteeing the average queue length. EEDOA can be implemented in an online way to make the task offloading decisions with polynomial time complexity. Theoretical analysis is given to demonstrate that EEDOA can approximate the minimal transmission energy consumption while still bounding the queue length. Experiments results are presented which shows the EEDOAâ€™s effectiveness. If you need more information, please refer to the current web page context.
