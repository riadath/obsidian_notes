#### <u>Summary</u>
The text you selected is about energy-efficient task offloading in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for Internet of Things (IoT). The authors propose an energy-efficient dynamic offloading algorithm called EEDOA to minimize the energy consumption of task offloading while guaranteeing the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">average queue length</mark>. EEDOA can be implemented in an online way to make the task offloading decisions with polynomial time complexity. Theoretical analysis is given to demonstrate that EEDOA can approximate the minimal transmission energy consumption while still bounding the queue length. Experiments results are presented which shows the EEDOAâ€™s effectiveness. If you need more information, please refer to the current web page context. 

#### <u> Important Terms from the summary</u>

##### <u>Average Queue Length : </u>  
The average queue length in IoT devices is a measure of how many tasks or packets are waiting to be processed or transmitted by the device. It can affect the performance, delay, and energy consumption of the device. Different queue management techniques and algorithms can be used to optimize the queue length and achieve the desired quality of service

##### <u>Stochastic Problem and Deterministic Problem</u>
**A stochastic optimization problem** is an optimization problem that involves randomness in some way. For example, the objective function may be affected by noise or uncertainty, or the optimization algorithm may use random variables to explore the search space.

In contrast **Deterministic Problems** do not involve any randomness. In deterministic optimization, all problem parameters are assumed to be known exactly and the objective function is deterministic.
