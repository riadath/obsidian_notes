# <u>Abstract</u>

### <u>Summary</u>
The abstract of this research paper that proposes a federated learning-based anomaly detection approach to proactively recognize intrusion in IoT networks using decentralized on-device data. The approach uses federated training rounds on Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) models and keeps the data intact on local IoT devices by sharing only the learned weights with the central server of the FL. The approach’s ensemble part aggregates the updates from multiple sources to optimize the global ML model’s accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms the classic/centralized machine learning (non-FL) versions in securing the privacy of user data and provides an optimal accuracy rate in attack detection.
