# <u>Abstract</u>

## Summary
The selected text is an abstract of a research paper that discusses the use of Federated Learning (FL) in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) within 6G networks. FL is used to protect consumer data privacy, but it can lead to expensive communication overheads. The authors propose an efficient-communication approach called FedCPF, which consists of three parts: Customized, Partial, and Flexible. FedCPF provides a customized local training strategy for vehicular clients, introduces a partial client participation rule, and presents a flexible aggregation policy for valid updates. Experimental results show that FedCPF outperforms the traditional FedAVG algorithm in terms of testing accuracy and communication optimization. Compared with the baseline, FedCPF achieves efficient communication with faster convergence speed and improves test accuracy by 6.31% on average, while the average communication optimization rate is improved by 2.15 times.

## <u>Important Terms</u>

[[Federated Learning]]

##### <u>An anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS):</u>
It is a type of cybersecurity system that aims to identify and detect abnormal or suspicious behavior within a network or system. Unlike signature-based IDS, which relies on predefined patterns of known attacks (signatures), anomaly-based IDS focuses on recognizing deviations from established normal patterns of network or user behavior.

##### <u>A multiclass classification model:</u> 
It is a type of machine learning model designed to categorize data into more than two classes or categories. Unlike binary classification models that classify data into two classes (e.g., yes/no, true/false), multiclass classification models can handle multiple classes simultaneously.

##### <u>Transfer learning:</u>
It is a machine learning technique that leverages knowledge gained from solving one problem to improve the performance of a related but different problem. In the context of deep learning, transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on a large dataset and applying it to a different but related task or dataset. This approach is particularly useful when the target dataset is small or lacks sufficient labeled examples for training a model from scratch.


##### <u>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</u>
They are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing and analyzing visual data, such as images and videos. They have shown remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, including image recognition, object detection, segmentation, and more. The key features that make CNNs effective for these tasks are their ability to automatically learn hierarchical patterns and features from the data.
