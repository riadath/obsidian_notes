Solving **Minesweeper** using algebraic topology is not a very well know or documented problem. I can provide you with some high level overview about how you might approach the problem and a python implementation of a **Minesweeper Solver** (without algebraic topology) in python. 



You can think of the minesweeper grid as a grid of simplices and the whole system as a simplicial complex. You should start by familiarizing yourself with the concepts of **Algebraic Topology** such as **Homology Groups** and **Betti Numbers**. 

- **Simplicial Complex:** In mathematics, a simplicial complex is a set composed of points, line segments, triangles, and their n-dimensional counterparts . Simplicial complexes should not be confused with the more abstract notion of a simplicial set appearing in modern simplicial homotopy theory.

- **Homology Groups:** Homology is a general way of associating a sequence of algebraic objects, such as abelian groups or modules, with other mathematical objects such as topological spaces.

- **Betti Numbers:** In algebraic topology, the Betti numbers are used to distinguish topological spaces based on the connectivity of n-dimensional simplicial complexes. For the most reasonable finite-dimensional spaces (such as compact manifolds, finite simplicial complexes or CW complexes), the sequence of Betti numbers is 0 from some point onward (Betti numbers vanish above the dimension of a space), and they are all finite.

It is recommended that you take help of existing python libraries such as `scipy` and `numpy` for any mathematical calculations.


# Minesweeper Solver Using Matrices
Given a 2D array `arr[][]` of dimensions `N*M`, representing a minesweeper matrix, where each cell contains an integer from the range `[0, 9]`, representing the number of mines in itself and all the eight cells adjacent to it, the task is to solve the minesweeper and uncover all the mines in the matrix. `Print ‘X’` for the cell containing a mine and ‘_’ for all the other empty cells. If it is not possible to solve the minesweeper, then `print “-1”`

Input Generation: To solve the given minesweeper matrix `arr[][]`, it must be a valid input i.e., the minesweeper matrix must be solvable. Therefore, the input matrix is generated in `generateMineField()` function. Follow the below steps to generate the input minesweeper matrix:

The inputs for the generation of input are the size of the minefield `N` and `M` and also probability `P` (or density) of the minefield.
A probability `P` is equal to 0 if there are no mines in the minefield and `P` is equal to 100 if all the cells are mines in the minefield.
A random number is chosen for each cell and if the random number is less than `P`, a mine is assigned to the grid and a Boolean array `mines[][]` is generated.
The input to the constraint solver is the status of each grid which counts the mines of itself and the eight cells around it.

# and columns of the matrix
N, M = 7, 7
 
# Stores the final generated input
arr = [[0 for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(N)]
 
# Direction arrays
dx = [-1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1]
dy = [0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1]

# cell location is valid
def isValid(x, y):
    # Returns true if valid
    return (x >= 0 and y >= 0
            and x < N and y < M)
 
# Function to generate a valid minesweeper
# matrix of size ROW * COL with P being
# the probability of a cell being a mine
def generateMineField(ROW, COL, P):
    # Generates the random
    # number every time

    # Stores whether a cell
    # contains a mine or not
    mines = [[False for _ in range(COL)] for _ in range(ROW)]
 
    # Iterate through each cell
    # of the matrix mine
    for x in range(ROW):
        for y in range(COL):
            # Generate a random value
            # from the range [0, 100]
            rand_val = random.randint(0, 100)
            # If rand_val is less than P
            if rand_val < P:
                # MArk mines[x][y] as True
                mines[x][y] = True
            # Otherwise, mark
            # mines[x][y] as False
            else:
                mines[x][y] = False
 
    print("Generated Input:")
 
    # Iterate through each cell (x, y)
    for x in range(ROW):
        for y in range(COL):
            arr[x][y] = 0
            # Count the number of mines
            # around the cell (x, y)
            # and store in arr[x][y]
            for k in range(9):
                # If current adjacent cell is valid
                if isValid(x + dx[k], y + dy[k]) and mines[x + dx[k]][y + dy[k]]:
                    arr[x][y] += 1
            # Print the value at
            # the current cell
            print(arr[x][y], end=" ")
        print()
