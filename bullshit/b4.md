To run the main function only when the Python file is called directly, you can use the variable `__name__`. When a Python script is executed, `__name__` is set to have the value `__main__` if the script is the main program being run. On the other hand, if the script is imported as a module, `__name__` is set to the module's name.

### The Variable `__name__`
Each time a Python module is imported, Python automatically assigns a string name to the dunder name (__name__) variable in that module’s namespace; normally this is the name of the module being imported as defined by its source file name (or package hierarchy name). The outermost module—the one that is there every time you run Python and requires no import—is always assigned “__main__“ as its name. It is the main module that is always present.

If you start my Python interpreter and print the value of `__name__`, you will see:
```python
>>> print(__name__)
__main__
>>>
```

Let's consider this example:

```python
def main():
    # Your main function code here
    print("This is the main function.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This block will only execute if the file is run directly
    main()
```

In this example, the `main()` function contains the code you want to run when the script is executed directly. The statement (`if __name__ == "__main__"`) ensures that the code inside it will only be executed when the script is run directly.
