## Technology Stack
The repo primarily consists of shell scripts and JSON files. (.sh and .json files)
## File Structure
- At the root level we have files such as `README.md`, `LICENSE` , `contributing.md` and a `configure` script
- `docs` contains a single file named `index.md`
- `src` contains all the individual directories for different tools and features. For example `terraform-asdf`, `youtube-dl` etc. Each of these directories have a similar structure to them.
	- A `bash_modules` folder
		- contains `ensure_curls.sh` file
	- A `devcontainer-feature.json` file
	- An `install.sh` file
	- A `README.md` file
- `tools` directory contains scripts such as `prebuild.sh` and `update-readme.js` 
- `wiki` directory contains documentation regarding the architecture, build and test processes. It also contains `Q&A.md` and `README.md` files. 

## Adding New Features
- Create a new folder under the src directory.
- Add any required `bash modules` , `devcontainer-feature.json`, `install.sh`, and `README.md` files.
- Add the `install.sh` script.
- Update documentation if required.

## Continuous Integration/CI
Details regarding CI setup is not explicitly mentioned in the file tree thus it is not possible to provide accurate information about how the CI exactly works.


## Developer Workflow
- Add features in the `src` directory
