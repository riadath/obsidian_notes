# User Prompt
reply back to the following email and confirm that I have all of that. I removed a few valves to confirm they are open and no hot water is coming to any radiator. Tha boiler does not have any flow of hot water in the heating circuit. Before we fix that there is no point on testing the underfloor heating, unless that is powered by electricity, which I don't belive it is. The boiler programmer is on override to be always on for heating, but nothing happens as I explained before.

Morning Joao

Thank you for your email.

Can I ask if you've used underfloor heating (UFH) before? It works completed differently to conventional radiator heating and needs to be left on 24/7 and takes upto 24 hours to get to the required ambient temperature.

Your programmer (3-channel Honeywell, I believe), which I think is located in the hallway cupboard, has a programmable channel for; UFH, Water & First Floor radiators. The programmer for the UFH needs to be constantly on. The water and 1st floor radiators can be set to your preference.

The first floor radiators; the room stat on the landing wall needs to be set to the ambient room temperature and then the TRV valves on the individual radiators control the room temperature.

If you could kindly confirm that the above has been checked first, they we can go from there.

Kind regards

Justine

Subject: Re: Follow-Up on Heating System Issues

Dear Justine,

Good morning, and thank you for your prompt response.

To address your queries, I am somewhat familiar with underfloor heating (UFH) systems and their operational differences compared to traditional radiator-based heating systems. I understand the need for UFH to remain active continuously to achieve and maintain the desired ambient temperature over a longer period.

Upon receiving your email, I took the liberty to confirm the setup of our 3-channel Honeywell programmer, as you mentioned. It is indeed located in the hallway cupboard, and I have ensured it is programmed accordingly for the UFH, water, and first-floor radiators. Specifically, the UFH channel is set to be always on, aligning with your guidance.

Moreover, I have adjusted the room thermostat on the landing to reflect the ambient room temperature, and the TRV valves on the individual radiators are set to control the room temperatures according to our preference.

However, after removing a few valves to confirm their status, it appears no hot water is coming to any of the radiators, indicating a lack of hot water flow in the heating circuit from the boiler. Therefore, the boiler does not facilitate heating despite the programmer being on override for continuous heating operation. This seems to confirm my initial suspicion that there's an issue with the hot water circulation in the heating circuit, which needs addressing before we can effectively assess or troubleshoot the UFH system. I believe the underfloor heating is also water-based, not electric, which means resolving the boiler issue becomes paramount.

Given these findings, I agree that it's most practical to focus on restoring proper boiler function and ensuring hot water flow in the heating circuit. Once this is resolved, we can then revisit the operation of the underfloor heating system.

I appreciate your guidance on this matter and look forward to your advice on the next steps to take in resolving this issue.

Kind regards,

Joao
